Markers of Biased or Fake News

Linguistic & Stylistic cues: Biased or fake articles often use loaded, emotive language and simple
phrasing. Studies show deceptive news tends to have simpler grammar and more emotional words (e.g.
extremes, hyperbole) than factual reports. For example, partisan outlets may use charged terms (like
“abortion law” vs “abortion rights” ) to signal ideology. Fake stories also pack headlines and text with
sensational or clickbait wording – ALL‑CAPS, exclamation points, outrage‑bait images, and hyperbolic
claims. Researchers note that liars often write with lower complexity and more affective language
(e.g. many adverbs or emotional adjectives). In contrast, neutral reporting uses precise, balanced
wording and avoids unverified superlatives or moralistic labels.

Structural & sourcing cues: Biased/fake news often violates standard reporting structure. Headlines
may wildly overstate the story, and key facts or context are buried or missing . Fake articles rarely cite
multiple, named sources – they rely on anonymous claims or single eyewitness quotes. Reputable
journalism requires named, traceable sources and multi‑sided attribution (Reuters advises using “named
sources whenever possible” and never citing plural sources when only one was interviewed ). In biased
pieces you’ll see no bylines, no clear sourcing, or only one perspective presented as fact. Misinformation
may also imitate official formatting (fake logos, fabricated quotes) without real links or footnotes. By
contrast, objective news follows the “inverted pyramid” (most important facts up front), credits authorities,
and clearly separates factual reporting from opinion.

Thematic & framing cues: Biased stories typically follow partisan narratives or conspiratorial themes.
Common patterns include “us vs. them” framing, blaming a scapegoat group or demonizing opponents,
and pushing a single consistent agenda (e.g. constant crisis or culture‑war themes). Content may revolve
around hot-button political topics in polarized ways. Empirical studies find media outlets on opposite sides
focus on the same topics but use different framing words. For instance, one outlet might highlight
rights while another highlights legislation on the same issue, subtly steering reader attitudes. Fake news
often emphasizes fear, injustice or scandal and omits nuance. Academics note that propaganda and
biased media tend to recycle simple ideological stereotypes and emotional appeal (e.g. appeals to
patriotism, gender or race stereotypes) to sway audiences. In contrast, neutral reporting frames
issues factually, providing context and multiple viewpoints.

Global research findings: Large-scale analyses confirm bias and misinformation are widespread but vary
by country and context. A University of Rochester study of 1.8 million U.S. headlines (2014–2022) found
growing polarization: outlets on the right and left showed systematic differences in word choice on political/
social issues . Global NLP research also finds that media bias is highly region-specific and event-driven
(e.g. coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war). Authoritarian regimes explicitly inject bias: studies show
China’s state media frames foreign news positively toward its trade partners and always blames “chaos” on
outsiders . In democracies, bias is subtler but real: audiences and journalists often disagree on
bothsidesism (the need for perfectly even coverage). Overall, independent reviews conclude that
most news outlets carry ideological leanings (intentionally or not), whereas truly objective reporting (neutral
tone, fact-checking emphasis) is rare.

Singapore’s Media Environment and Bias

State-controlled media: Singapore’s mainstream press is largely government-linked (owned by
state-affiliated conglomerates), so reporting typically reflects official viewpoints. Press freedom
watchdogs note “little respect for press freedom and editorial independence” under the ruling party, and
laws discourage dissent. Journalists often avoid challenging the government, so local news
emphasizes stability and positive spin on PAP policies.

Fake-news law (POFMA): In 2019 Singapore passed POFMA, empowering the government to label
and require corrections of online “false statements.” Critics argue this makes the state “the sole
arbiter of what information is permissible online” and even the “ultimate fact-checker” . In
practice, POFMA directives target political speech by opposition figures or citizen journalists more
than mainstream media. Research shows POFMA’s introduction amplified hard news and local
politics coverage (and audience engagement) – an indication that media followed official signals on
which topics to emphasize.

Misinformation markers in Singaporean context: Bias or fake content here often looks like
government spin. Watch for articles that copy official press releases almost verbatim, omit criticism,
or cite only ruling‑party sources. Disinformation in Singapore tends to be quickly “fact-checked” by
state agencies; thus false local claims often carry government rebuttals. By contrast, independent
fact-checkers note that foreign or social media sources (not bound by POFMA) sometimes break
news with less restraint, but they lack reach in Singapore. Overall, the absence of alternative
narratives is itself a marker: if all outlets report identically, bias is baked in.

Objective vs. Biased Reporting Standards

Neutral reporting norms: Ethical journalism standards (AP, Reuters, etc.) stress accuracy, balance
and transparency. For example, Reuters’ guidelines mandate holding “accuracy sacrosanct”, seeking
“fair comment”, and “striv[ing] for balance and freedom from bias” . Reporters are advised to avoid
inserting their own opinions, and to correct errors openly. Objective articles attribute statements to
sources (e.g. “according to X”), present multiple viewpoints, and use neutral descriptors (e.g. “alleges”
instead of “proves”). Newsrooms train writers to fact-check and quantify (using numbers or named
evidence) rather than relying on unnamed claims.

Contrasts with biased/fake content: By contrast, biased or fake stories flout these standards. They
present opinion or unverified claims as fact, rarely label sources clearly, and do not issue corrections
when wrong. They use subjective or emotional language instead of objective phrasing. Where
neutral reporting would say “is alleged to have”, biased content might say “did” without evidence.
Essentially, biased pieces violate Reuters/AP principles by failing on accuracy and balance.
Media watchdogs emphasize that consumers should watch for these violations: outrageous
headlines, lack of attribution, and opinionated tone are red flags.

Sources: Academic studies and reports (see citations) have systematically identified the above markers
across countries. Media watchdogs (e.g. Reuters Institute, Reporters Without Borders) corroborate that
press freedom, editorial standards, and misinformation laws strongly shape how biased a news outlet’s
content can be. Each bullet above is supported by expert analysis or research findings.
